    "================================================\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has the following prerequisites:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Chapter 4 - Artificial Neural Networks (p. 81) of [_Machine Learning_ by Mitchell, Tom M. (1997), Paperback](https://a.co/d/bjmsEOg)\n",

    "\n",
    "We all heard of this buz word \"LLM\" (Large Language Model). But let's put that aside for just a second and look at a much simpler one called \"character-level language model\" where, for example, we input a prefix of a word such as \"hell\" and the model outputs a complete word \"hello\". That is, this language model predicts the next character of a character sequence. This is like a Math function where we have:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "  f(\\text{“hell\"}) = \\text{“hello\"}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we call inputs like \"hell\" as __sequence__. \n",
    "\n",
    "How do we obtain a function like this? One approach is to have 4 black boxes, each of which takes a single character as input and calculates an output:\n",

    "    <img src=\"./img/rnn-4-black-boxes.png\" width=\"30%\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "But one might have noticed that if the 3rd function (box) produces $f('l') = 'l'$, then why would the 4th function (box), given the same input, gives a different output of 'o'? This suggest that we should take the __history__ into account. Instead of having $f$ depend on 1 parameter, we now have it take 2 parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. a character;\n",
    "2. a variable that summarizes the previous calculations:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if we want to predict a longer or shorter word? For example, how about predicting \"cat\" by \"ca\"? That's simple,\n",
    "we will have 2 black boxes to do the work.\n",

    "What if the function $f$ is not smart enough to produce the correct output everytime? We will simply collect a lot of examples such as \"cat\" and \"hello\", and feed them into the boxes to train them until they can output correct vocabulary like \"cat\" and \"hello\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the idea behind RNN. It's recurrent because the boxed function gets invoked repeatedly for each element of the sequence. In the case of our character-level language model, element is a character such as \"e\" and sequence is a string like \"hell\"\n",

A natural way to represent discrete variables is to regard the output $\\boldsymbol{o}$ as giving the unnormalized log probabilities of each possible value of the discrete variable. We can then apply the softmax (we will disucss softmax function in the next section) operation as a post-processing step to obtain a vector $\\boldsymbol{\\hat{y}}$ of normalized probabilities over the output. Forward propagation begins with a specification of the initial state $\\boldsymbol{h}^{(0)}$. Then, for each time step from $t = 1$ to $t = \\tau$, we apply the following update equations:\n",
